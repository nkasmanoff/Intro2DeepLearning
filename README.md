In this repository I go through the YouTube coding series "Intro to Deep Learning" by Siraj Raval, and hope to gain from this a firmer understanding of the data preprocessing techniques used going into a deep learning (or any ML) related issue, and a firmer understanding in both how deep learning works, and its various applications. There are many videos in this series, and for the sake of efficency I'll only be tackling the challenges I deem most relevant, difficult, or interesting. 


Here's a link to the videos I'm using: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2-dafEMk2A7YdKv4XfKpfbTH5z6rEEj3



In the first two training videos the basics of neural networks are covered, something I've exposed myself to constantly, and don't think I'll get much out of rewriting the same simple linear regression lines I've seen for every "how to ML" book or lecture I've used. 

So to start, I'm beginning with episode #3, sentiment analysis. The lower level directories in this repo will follow a logical flow of this process, and without further ado, let's start!
